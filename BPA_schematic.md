The backward progressive algorithm (BPA) predicts caste identities in previous developmental stages, using non-validated transcriptomes at the target stage (S<sub>t</sub>) to construct PCAs and then projects these onto the subsequent stage (S<sub>t+1</sub>) where caste identities are known. The BPA then uses the known caste labels at S<sub>t+1</sub> to identify PCs that are associated with confirmed caste identity and uses linear discriminant analysis to train a predictive model, assuming that the PCs at S<sub>t+1</sub> are also associated with caste identities at S<sub>t</sub> as expected from developmental continuity. The trained model then predicts caste identities at S<sub>t</sub>, after which it assumes these predicted caste identities to be real and initiates a next round to predict caste identities at stage S<sub>t-1</sub>. This process continues until the prediction likelihoods at S<sub>t-n</sub> become too low to be informative.
