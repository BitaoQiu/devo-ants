Key codes for _Towards a developmental biology of superorganisms: reconstructing the canalized trajectories of caste differentiation in ants_ 
> Please contact bitao.qiu.88 [at] gmail.com if any question.

**Outline:**

* Construction of developmental trajectory network: [Devo_trajectory](Devo_trajectory.R).
* Backward Progressive Algorithm: [BPA](BPA.R) and [a schematic view](BPA_schematic.md).
* Quantification of caste developmental potential: [Developmental potential](developmental_potential.R) and [a schematic view](developmental_potential_schematic.md).
* Quantification of canalization score at gene level: [Canalization at gene level](canalisation_score_gene_level.R) and [a schematic view](canalizaed_gene_level_scheme.md).
* Detection of differentially expressed genes that independent of body size difference: [Size-independent DEGs](deg_size_independent.R) .
* Threshold regression model (detecting the body-size threshold that changes the expression pattern): .
