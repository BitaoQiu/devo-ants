Codes for Towards a developmental biology of superorganisms: reconstructing the canalized trajectories of caste differentiation in ants 

**Outline:**

* Construction of developmental trajectory network.
* Backward Progressive Algorithm (BPA).
* Quantification of caste developmental potential.
* Quantification of canalization score at gene level.
* Quantification beteween-species transcriptomic similarity.
* Detection of differentially expressed genes that independent of body size difference.
* Threshold regression model (detecting the body-size threshold that changes the expression pattern).
* Correction for batch effect.
