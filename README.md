Codes for _Towards a developmental biology of superorganisms: reconstructing the canalized trajectories of caste differentiation in ants_ 

**Outline:**

* Construction of developmental trajectory network: [Devo_trajectory](Devo_trajectory.R).
* Backward Progressive Algorithm: [BPA](BPA.R) and [Schematic view of BPA](BPA_schematic.md).
* Quantification of caste developmental potential: .
* Quantification of canalization score at gene level: .
* Quantification between-species transcriptomic similarity: .
* Detection of differentially expressed genes that independent of body size difference: .
* Threshold regression model (detecting the body-size threshold that changes the expression pattern): .
* Correction for batch effect: .
